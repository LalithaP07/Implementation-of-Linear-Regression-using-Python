# Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-using-Python

📝 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression using Python. Linear regression is one of the simplest and most commonly used algorithms for predictive modeling in statistics and machine learning. The notebook walks through building a linear regression model from scratch and/or using libraries such as scikit-learn, visualizing results, and interpreting the model's performance.

📚 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Simple Linear Regression using scikit-learn
- Visualization with matplotlib and/or seaborn

Model evaluation using metrics like:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score
- Predictive plotting and residual analysis

🧠 Concepts Covered
- Understanding the linear relationship between independent and dependent variables
- Estimating coefficients (slope and intercept)
- Making predictions
- Evaluating model fit and error

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
